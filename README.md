# IEP Documentation

**This is a branch of the SATIMGE documentation describing the IEP project methodology.**

## Introduction 
WWF South Africa (WWF) have embarked on a process to equip stakeholders to engage effectively in the process of integrated energy planning, following the enactment of Section 6 of the National Energy Act of 2008 thereby mandating the Department of Minerals and Energy Resources (DMRE) to develop and update the official Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) for South Africa. The Energy Systems Research Group (ESRG) has been appointed by WWF to provide technical analysis and an evidence base to support WWF’s process of engagement with stakeholders for the IEP. 
This methodological paper highlights the processes, assumptions and structures of the long-term energy systems modelling analysis that will be undertaken in this work to inform and develop the evidence base upon which stakeholders can engage with the IEP process. 

The Energy Systems Research Group (ESRG) has been contracted, funded and supported by WWF South Africa (WWF-SA) to develop an evidence base to inform WWF-SA’s development of an Illustrative IEP. 

## Documentation

More specific information about the SATIM-eSAGE model can be found in the main branch of the model documentation [Documentation](/docs/source/01Introduction.md).

## About the developers

The list of developers, contributors and reviewers is described in the [Acknowledgements section](/docs/source/9999Acknowledgements.md).

SATIM-eSAGE is the successor model to the **South Africa TIMES Model (SATIM)** , which has been developed by the **Energy Research Centre at UCT** funded through various projects, and has played a significant role in informing the evidence based climate target setting in South Africa.
