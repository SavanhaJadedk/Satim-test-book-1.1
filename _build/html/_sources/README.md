# SATIM-eSAGE Linked Model Framework

## Purpose of Linkage

Both the **SATIM** and **eSAGE** model are robust models for evaluating long and medium term energy goals, however both have a pitfall in their scope.

SATIM can be used to analyse energy policies—for example, renewable energy targets or a nuclear
programme— but, although the impact on electricity prices and GHG emissions of such policies
can be estimated, it is not possible to quantify the economy-wide implications (e.g. GDP,
employment, and household welfare) without the help of some form of economic model.

In its current configuration, eSAGE, like other models of its type, has limited ability to
endogenously capture technical change while ensuring technical feasibility for very long-term
scenarios where there are large departures from baseline projections.

Combining SATIM and eSAGE enables a more nuanced examination of policies, considering their socioeconomic impacts. It addresses the need for a sophisticated tool to explore and assess different policy scenarios, shedding light on the trade-offs between mitigation and development objectives in the South African context.

## About the developers

The list of developers, contributors and reviewers is described in the [Acknowledgements section](/docs/source/9999Acknowledgements.md).

SATIM-eSAGE is the successor model to the **South Africa TIMES Model (SATIM)** , which has been developed by the **Energy Research Centre at UCT** funded through various projects, and has played a significant role in informing the evidence based climate target setting in South Africa.
