# 3. eSAGE Model Structure

eSAGE is a  a **recursive, dynamic CGE, country-level, economy-wide model** that simulates the functioning of the South African economy.It captures the functioning and direct/indirect linkages between profit-maximizing industries, utility-maximizing households, government, and the rest of the world. eSAGE is considered an experimental lab to explore what-if scenarios for the economy's evolution over time, given shocks such as changes in policy, labor supply, technology, or international fuel and technology costs while ensuring strong internal consistency.

The social accounting matrix (SAM) in eSAGE, a linked modelling framework, includes Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) and the government, household, and 'rest of the world' sectors. The SAM provides a comprehensive representation of the flows of energy commodities, monetary flows, and physical flows. It involves a **hybridization process** that calibrates the monetary flows in the SAM to reflect the actual physical flows of energy commodities, typically achieved by combining flows reported in national energy balances and energy commodity prices paid by different sectors/households.

The model is limited in its ability to endogenously capture technical change for very long-term scenarios with large departures from baseline projections, particularly in terms of ensuring technical feasibility.
