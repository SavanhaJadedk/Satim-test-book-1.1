# 1. Introduction
 ## 1.1 Project Overview

Welcome to the read-the-docs for the **SATIM-eSAGE** linked modelling framework.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to **SATIM-eSAGE**, a  linked modeling framework combines the SATIM (South African TIMES Model) and eSAGE (Energy South African General Equilibrium Model) to analyze the socioeconomic impacts of energy and climate policies in South Africa.The linked framework involves an iterative process of exchanging information between SATIM and eSAGE to produce comprehensive and consistent results.

Its purpose is to enhance transparency and accessibility to the model, widely utilized for policymaking and critical analysis. By doing so, it seeks to contribute more broadly to the advancement and utilization of energy systems models in developing countries.

 ## 1.2 Motivation

The motivation behind the SATIM-eSAGE linked modeling framework lies in its ability to provide comprehensive and consistent results, thereby enhancing the analysis of energy and climate policies in South Africa. By combining SATIM and eSAGE, the framework enables a more nuanced examination of policies, considering their socioeconomic impacts. It addresses the need for a sophisticated tool to explore and assess different policy scenarios, shedding light on the trade-offs between mitigation and development objectives in the South African context.

 ## 1.3 The South Africa Times Model (SATIM)

The South African Times Model (SATIM) is a a single-region, multi-sector, and multi-time period bottom-up TIMES model that represents the South African Energy system. It provides detailed representations of all economic sectors, each of which is adapted to best represent energy demand or supply within that sector. The South African Times Model (SATIM) evolved from a traditional TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model, adapting the framework to the South African context. It included unique characteristics such as residential energy access inequality, the use of multiple fuels within households, complex coal supply networks, and representation of Gas-to-Liquid and Coal-to-Liquid plants. This model serves as the foundation for computing the least-cost energy technology mix and investment plans, contributing valuable information to the linked modeling framework.

## 1.4 The Energy South Africa General Equilibrium model (eSAGE)  

 eSAGE operates as a dynamic, recursive, economy-wide, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model. This model simulates the functioning of the South African economy, providing insights into the broader economic implications of energy and climate policies.The integration of both SATIM and eSAGE ensures a holistic analysis, capturing the intricate interplay between the energy sector and the broader economic landscape.


## 1.5 SATIMel-eSAGE link

The linkages from SATIM to eSAGE involve alternate runs of the models, facilitating the exchange of information via data links. SATIM computes the least-cost energy technology mix and investment plan, transmitted to eSAGE for incorporation into its simulations. Conversely, economic indicators generated in eSAGE are fed back to SATIM for further optimization, resulting in a continuous and iterative process that aligns energy utilization and economic impacts in both models.This linked modeling framework offers a powerful capability to analyze diverse scenarios and policy options, providing crucial insights into the complex trade-offs between mitigation and development objectives in South Africa.
