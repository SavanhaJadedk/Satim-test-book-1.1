    "## Data Sources and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of households into income groups and the primary fuel used by households for cooking, space heating, and water heating draws primarily on the 2011 Census (StatsSA, 2011), while electrification assumptions are according to the National Development Plan (National Planning Commission, 2012). Households in all income groups use a variety of fuels to meet their energy service needs and, particularly in middle- and low-income households, typically use more than one fuel type to meet energy services (e.g., both biomass and electricity for cooking) – a principle known as fuel stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower income groups have more prominent use of liquid (paraffin) and solid fuels (coal and wood) and lower demand for energy services supplied by electricity due to lower appliance ownership levels. The fuel stacking and lower energy service demands of the low- and middle-income households in the model reflect the difficulties that these households face in terms of both access to and the affordability of using electricity to supply energy services. The energy sources, and quantity, supplying each end use in 2017 is shown in Figure 8.1. This is illustrated in further detail in Appendix A and Figures A1 to A3.\n",

    "## Technologies and Efficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Within SATIM, household energy service needs, such as lighting and cooking, are met by technologies such as LEDs or CFLs (subject to 2024 regulations on minimum luminous efficacy) and electric or paraffin stoves. Technologies, and their assumed average efficiencies, are specific to the type of technology and fuel being used. For example, an electric geyser can be used to supply hot water at 75% efficiency, whereas wood used for water heating in low-income households (open fire) has an efficiency of 11%. This allows us to capture the average energy efficiency of meeting energy service needs using different fuels and technologies as well as the impact that a shift in fuel or technology use will have on the demand for energy to supply energy services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology efficiencies can be specific to income groups, e.g., lower-income households are more likely to have old and less efficient fridges. Efficiency levels also capture shifts between electrical appliances, for example, the increased penetration of LEDs for lighting, or the uptake of combined-heat-and-power (CHP) and solar water heaters (SWH) for water heating. The upward mobility of households from lower to middle- and higher-income groups, driven by growth in GDP, will cause an increase in electricity use in favor of other alternative fuels over time, as households increase their appliance ownership as their income grows. Increases in electricity use are however partially tempered by energy efficiency improvements in the sector, based on assumptions about the efficacy of the Standards and Labelling programme and Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for appliances (DMRE, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Household Mobility\n",
    "\n",
    "Upward mobility of households is captured in the model by altering the share of households in each income group over time. The share of households in each income group is taken from SAGE. However, under current projections, not all households would be able to migrate out of the lower income group by 2050. Many of these households are currently in a state of energy poverty and may struggle to move away from the use of solid fuels without support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Residential Demand Illustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 show SANKEY diagrams of residential consumption of fuels to provide energy services in the three income groups in 2023. The SANKEYs give an indicative indication of the energy used by households in each income group, the energy used to supply energy services, as well as the efficiency at which energy services are met in each income group. For example, it shows that low-income households use biomass primarily for cooking and that the efficiency of cooking is low. In addition to biomass, low-income households are also using electricity, coal, and a small amount of paraffin to cook. Energy service demands are represented in terms of useful energy and are therefore not directly comparable across energy services but are comparable across income groups."
